# ImageResizer

This is a simple image-resizing app. It uses *UIPanGestureRecognizer*, *UITapGestureRecognizer*, *UIPinchGestureRecognizer* and another custom *UIPanGestureRecognizer* - like resizing for the image with aspect ratio being saved.

I hope that someone finds this useful for inspiration :)
